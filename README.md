# KineBOT

This is the README for the KineBOT code.
This project will use a conjunction of HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery/plotty.js to create a modular n-DoF kinematic simulation of a robotic arm.

This is an open-source code that will be used for simulation/example purposes. If you'd like to clone/add more functionalities, please fork and play with it. The only thing that we ask is to give us credit, or refer back to this repo, and not change the layout.
